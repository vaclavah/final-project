## Project Proposal

Name(s) of the folks involved in this project: Vendy Hazukova

Working title: Can expansion of habitat predict differences in benthic diatom species richness? 

Project summary (1-2 sentences): In West Greenland, lake sediments have archived ecosystem shifts in response to abrupt climate change. One of the ecosystem shifts has been increase in lakewater clarity that has led to expansion of littoral habitat for benthic diatoms. Here, I will examine two sets of benthic diatom communities from surface sediments; one was collected before climate shift in 1996, the second one represents post-shift communities, collected in 2013. 

What is especially interesting (to you!) about this project?: Benthic diatoms in sediment cores are often used to interpret past environmental changes. Considering we do not know much about their ecologies, shifts in their abundance are usually interpreted as expansion or shriking of their habitat. This dataset provides a unique opportunity to test whether this interpretation is robust.

How do you plan to tackle this project?: I will compare species accumulation rates between the two datasets. 

What concepts or tools from class relate to this project?: loosely related to SAR, island biogeography, and neutral theory

What additional resources (code, data, literature) would support this project?: N/A

How can Andy or Renata help?: Andy has already helped so much!! Thank you!!
